CSCI 585 HW1

We are assuming that all the students are signing up for the classes/projects. There is no null value in any of the attributes.

1. Students will sign-up for multiple coding classes and projects. Similarly, classes/projets will contain multiple students. Therefore, it is an m:n relationship, we'll need to draw a bridge table for both the relationships.

2. Instructor would teach multiple classes and oversee multiple projects. In the same way, classes/projects will have multiple instructors.

3. Each Instrutor could specify a textbook for more than one class that he/she teaches. 

4. A class can have multiple Instructors. Hence, there can be multiple reference books for a class

5. Instructor would get paid based on hours they teach and hours they supervise projects

6. Projects are done in group of 4 students. Groups would sit in front of the table they're assigned, to work on a project. One student can belong to multiple groups at the same time

7. Each table is provided with all the parts required for the projects

8. Each project require differet parts specific to it. The parts will be ordered from various suppliers. There, are multiple orders from multiple vendors. Hence, it is m:n relationship.

9. There are several rooms that'll be available for the classes and projects. 
The students will be provided a schedule for the same.
So many students can have the same schedule and a schedule will be same for many students.

10. A student can check out multiple books(max 4) at a time from the library(Here, we're considering there is only one library). 

11. A student can rate their instructor, class and project at the end of the curriculum. Each score will be stored in the Rating table.
